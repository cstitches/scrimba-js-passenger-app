First project in the Scrimba Learn Javascript tutorial.

Made a passenger counter app, which features a counter and save function with relevant informational displays to the user.

Users click the "Increment" button to increment the counter by 1, which is displayed to the user above the buttons.

Users can click the "Save" button to record the current count below the buttons. This also resets the counter back to 0.

Multiple saved counts are recorded as a list of saves as well as a running total.

The running total is a feature I added beyond the scope of the tutorial.
